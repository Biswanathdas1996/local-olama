# Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong
- PPTX files were being processed by Docling successfully
- But images weren't being extracted because they were stored as base64 URI strings
- Code was looking for PIL Image objects instead

## What Was Fixed
1. **Added base64 decoding** - Now extracts images from `picture.image.uri` data URIs
2. **Enhanced section extraction** - Creates sections from slides when standard extraction fails
3. **Better logging** - Added detailed logging for PPTX processing

## How to Test
Upload your PPTX file and check:
```
data/docling_output/The_Future_of_Autonomous_AI_MultiAgent_Orchestration_<timestamp>/images/
```

You should now see PNG files extracted from your slides!

## Expected Output
```
âœ… PPTX IMAGE EXTRACTION
   File: The_Future_of_Autonomous_AI_MultiAgent_Orchestration.pptx
   Slides: 12
   Images: 3
   Output: data/docling_output/.../images
```
